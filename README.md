# Modality Appointments Cleaning Script

This is a simple Python command line program that takes the raw appointment data and cleans into a format that is easily interpreted by Google BigQuery and Data Studio.

Usage: `python appointments_clean.py "input_file.xlsx" "output_file.xlsx"`

Where "input_file.xlsx" is the file to be cleaned and "output_file.xlsx" is the desired filename and or destination of the cleaned output file.

To run this code please clone this repository to your local machine and ensure that the file to be cleaned is within the same directory as the python file. If not, please enter the full file path for input_file. Likewise if you would like output_file.xlsx to be exported to a location other than project project directory, please supply the full desired file path.
